# pyCMO v1.3.0

Release Date: November 27th, 2023

Cut Date: November 27th, 2023

## Changes
* pyCMO now works with scenarios run on turbo or double turbo speeds
* Improved pyCMO's reliability to interact with Command. There is now a `SteamClientProps` class that can be used to tweak settings for `SteamClient` to fit each scenario. For example, on scenarios where there is a shorter amount of time between data exports, it is better to increase the delay before each action (e.g. sending keys, checking whether specific windows exist) so that we do not miss anything.
* Scenario time is correctly outputted by `print_env_information`
* Added logging (INFO and DEBUG) to several modules
* Updated `actions.py` to work with the Steam version of Command as well as added several new features like the ability to sample a random action based on the given observation
* Updated project's license

### Internal
* Replaced batch and ps scripts that were used to get windows or send keys to certain applications with [pywin32](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32)
* `init.lua` now sets up a default trigger to end the scenario (when time runs out). This should be set by the user for custom conditions to end the scenario.
* `pycmo_lib.lua` now contains a new function called `teardown_and_end_scen` that gets run before the scenario to do teardown things like note the scenario has ended, export the final observation, etc.
