# pyCMO v1.2.0

Release Date: November 19th, 2023

Cut Date: November 19th, 2023

## Changes
* Created `floridistan` scenario to demonstrate an agent controlling an aircraft to strike a target
* Add support for exporting a side's contacts to `ScenEdit_ExportScenarioToXML`
* Add functionality in `protocol` to restart a scenario, end a scenario, and check/record when a scenario has ended
* Updated `run_loop` to include a function to run an RL loop with the Steam version of Command
* Added to `init.lua` so that observations are recorded when the scenario first loads

### Internal
* Separated the creation of sample agents and the running of the demo from `sample_agent.py`. `sample_agent.py` now contains the definition of the sample agent while `demo.py` contains the actual demo.
* Updated `config.py` to record the version of Command: Modern Operations
* Added various batch and PowerShell scripts to automate mouse clicks in support of [https://github.com/duyminh1998/pycmo/issues/20]
