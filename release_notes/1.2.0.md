# pyCMO v1.2.0

Release Date: November 19th, 2023

Cut Date: November 19th, 2023

## Changes
* Created `floridistan` scenario to demonstrate an agent controlling an aircraft to strike a target
* Add support for exporting a side's contacts to `ScenEdit_ExportScenarioToXML`
* Add functionality in `protocol` to restart a scenario, end a scenario, and check/record when a scenario has ended
* Updated `run_loop` to include a function to run an RL loop with the Steam version of Command
* Added to `init.lua` so that observations are recorded when the scenario first loads and added a function to record whether a scenario has ended
* Added release notes for pyCMO 1.0.0, 1.1.0, and 1.2.0

### Internal
* Separated the creation of sample agents and the running of the demo from `sample_agent.py`. `sample_agent.py` now contains the definition of the sample agent while `demo.py` contains the actual demo.
* Updated `config.py` to record the version of Command: Modern Operations
* Added various batch and PowerShell scripts to automate mouse clicks in support of https://github.com/duyminh1998/pycmo/issues/20
* Per https://github.com/duyminh1998/pycmo/issues/25, `protocol` will automatically restart the scenario until the time compression is set correctly (it does not check for this) or the scenario has been properly recorded as not ended (the main thing it checks for)
* Per https://github.com/duyminh1998/pycmo/issues/26, `protocol` will automatically press the "Enter scenario" button on the "Side selection and briefing" screen that popups when a scenario is loaded or reloaded until the popup goes away
